        <!-- Introduction -->
        <p class="text-lg mb-8" style="color: var(--color-text-secondary);">
          Sleep is very important to me. I've found some things that helped me over the years. Nothing is fancy or very original.
        </p>

        <!-- Before going to bed -->
        <div class="mb-12">
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6" style="color: var(--color-text);">Before going to bed</h2>
          <ul class="space-y-4 text-lg" style="color: var(--color-text-secondary);">
            <li>
              <strong>Digital boundaries:</strong> No computer one hour before going to bed. No work especially if I can help it; otherwise, it will take me 2+ hours to fall asleep.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Food:</strong> No food at least 30 minutes before bed. I am a night eater and can feel very hungry, but the feeling always disappears once I am in bed. Not allowing food in the bedroom helps prevent the body from expecting it. I have also completely stopped eating fast food (Pizza, McDonald's) for dinner because I realized it consistently causes me to wake up in the middle of the night. I only keep it exceptional at lunch with friends.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Bedroom -->
        <div class="mb-12">
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6" style="color: var(--color-text);">Bedroom</h2>
          <ul class="space-y-4 text-lg" style="color: var(--color-text-secondary);">
            <li>
              <strong>Light:</strong> Absolute darkness. I have double curtains so that even when I wake up in the morning and my eyes are adjusted to darkness, I still can't see anything.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Audio:</strong> I keep a fan running (facing the wall during winter) to cancel occasional outside noise. In places without silence, I use earplugs, though I have to retrain my ears to the fan noise when I return home.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Comfort:</strong> I keep my bedroom cold (very cold) and stay warm with a weighted blanket. I need to feel like my bed is protecting me from the hell that the outside is.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Aesthetics:</strong> On another note, my bed is all white and yours should be too because dark sheets are an ick.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Phone -->
        <div class="mb-12">
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6" style="color: var(--color-text);">Phone</h2>
          <ul class="space-y-4 text-lg" style="color: var(--color-text-secondary);">
            <li>
              <strong>Sleep Mode:</strong> I must spend less than 10 minutes scrolling social media to sleep well. Then the phone is put in Sleep mode, which I programmed to show no notifications and hide all apps from the homescreen except for Books and Manga apps.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Brightness:</strong> Set to the absolute minimum. I use the Reduce White Point accessibility feature and added a shortcut (triple-click power button).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Falling asleep -->
        <div class="mb-12">
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6" style="color: var(--color-text);">Falling asleep</h2>
          <ul class="space-y-4 text-lg" style="color: var(--color-text-secondary);">
            <li>
              <strong>Guiding support:</strong> My brain usually spirals and I cannot fall asleep by myself. I usually read a book on my Kindle or phone (still minimum brightness) in a sleeping position where only my finger moves. If I follow my protocol correctly, my brain gets quickly saturated from reading and shuts down.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- In case of emergencies -->
        <div class="mb-12">
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6" style="color: var(--color-text);">In case of emergencies</h2>
          <ul class="space-y-4 text-lg" style="color: var(--color-text-secondary);">
            <li>
              If I know I am in for a rough night, I take 1.5 mg of melatonin. I try to avoid it as it causes lucid dreams.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Travel:</strong> When traveling, I start at 3 mg and reduce the dose by 1 mg every following week to get adjusted to the new timezone.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Tracking -->
        <div class="mb-12">
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6" style="color: var(--color-text);">Tracking</h2>
          <ul class="space-y-4 text-lg" style="color: var(--color-text-secondary);">
            <li>
              Sleep trackers usually just tell me what I already know, but I am a stupid data geek so I bought one. I use a Withings Sleep Pad under the mattress. It's a "set & forget" type that requires no subscription, charge or wearable device.
